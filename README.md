## Introduction
Secure messaging is essential for protecting the confidentiality and integrity of communications over networks. The Secure Messaging Protocol 25519 (smp25519) provides a robust framework for secure messaging by leveraging modern cryptographic primitives. This implementation in Rust aims to provide a secure and efficient solution for developers looking to incorporate secure messaging into their applications.

## Features
- **X25519 Key Exchange:** Utilizes the X25519 elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange for secure key agreement.
- **Blake3 Hash Function:** Employs the fast and secure Blake3 cryptographic hash function for data integrity verification.
- **ChaCha20 Encryption:** Uses the ChaCha20 stream cipher for symmetric encryption of messages.
- **Secure Network Communication:** Designed for secure messaging over network sockets using UDP protocol.
- **API Bindings:** Provides API bindings for easy integration with existing Rust codebases.
- **Efficient and Reliable Messaging:** Ensures secure and reliable messaging between endpoints.

## Installation
To install the smp25519-rust library, you can simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smp25519-rust.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/smp25519-rust/releases) section.

## Usage
To start using smp25519-rust in your project, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
smp25519 = "0.1.0"
```

Then, import the library into your Rust code and start using the secure messaging features:

```rust
use smp25519::{Smp25519Client, Smp25519Server};

// Create a client and server instances
let client = Smp25519Client::new();
let server = Smp25519Server::new();

// Perform key exchange and send encrypted messages
client.perform_key_exchange();
server.perform_key_exchange();
let encrypted_message = client.encrypt_message("Hello, server!");
let decrypted_message = server.decrypt_message(&encrypted_message);
println!("Decrypted message: {}", decrypted_message);
```
